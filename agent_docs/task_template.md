# Task Template: Time Oddity Development

> **Copy this template for each new task. Fill in all sections.**

---

## Task Title
_A concise, descriptive title for the task._

## Objective
_What is the goal? What feature, fix, or improvement is being delivered?_

## Documentation References
- [ ] List all relevant sections from `comprehensive_documentation.md` (including Testing and Mocking)
- [ ] Link to any related design docs, diagrams, or previous tasks

## Pre-Implementation Design & Impact
- **Files/Classes to Change:**
  - _List all files/classes/modules that will be created, modified, or deleted._
- **Integration Points:**
  - _What systems, state machines, or external libraries are affected?_
- **Mocking/Test Setup:**
  - _What needs to be mocked? Are new mocks/utilities required?_
- **Potential Risks/Complexity:**
  - _Any anticipated challenges or areas likely to cause test breakage?_

## TDD Test Plan
- **Test Files to Create/Update:**
  - _List all test files (unit/integration) that will be created or updated._
- **Test Cases:**
  - _Describe the main test cases and edge cases to be covered._
- **Test Data/Mocks Needed:**
  - _List any new mock data or test helpers required._

## Task Breakdown & Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] _Atomic sub-task 1_: _Description and acceptance criteria_
- [ ] _Atomic sub-task 2_: _Description and acceptance criteria_
- [ ] ...

## Expected Output
_Describe the observable deliverable or change that should result from this task (e.g., new feature visible in-game, passing tests, console output, etc.)._

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Expected output is achieved and verified
- [ ] All project tests pass (locally and in CI)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (including Testing and Mocking section if relevant)
- [ ] No new linter or type errors
- [ ] No regressions in related features
- [ ] Task marked as complete in tracking system
- [ ] **Task is marked as completed in the relevant tracking file (e.g., by updating the checkbox or adding a completion note in the phase/task file)**

## Git Handling
- [ ] All changes are committed with clear, descriptive messages
- [ ] Changes are pushed to the correct feature branch (specify branch name if needed)
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main/develop before merge
- [ ] Pull request created and linked to task (if applicable)

## Post-Mortem / Retrospective (fill in if needed)
- _If this task caused test breakage, required significant rework, or revealed process gaps, document what happened and how to avoid it in the future._
