## Proposed Stack

This section outlines the recommended packages and libraries for the core components of the game. Each selection is justified through the lens of LLM compatibility, aiming to create a stable and predictable foundation for the AI agents to build upon.

### Game Logic and Rendering

*   **Phaser 3**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://phaser.io/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A fast, free, and open-source HTML5 game framework for creating 2D games. It offers WebGL and Canvas rendering, a built-in physics engine (Arcade Physics), sprite and animation management, input handling, and audio management.[6, 7]
    *   **Justification:** Phaser is the optimal choice for an AI-driven project due to its "batteries-included" nature and unparalleled LLM fluency. As a comprehensive framework, it provides a large but internally consistent API surface, which eliminates the significant challenge of having an LLM integrate multiple, disparate libraries for rendering, physics, and inputâ€”a common point of failure for generative models.[8, 9] Most critically, Phaser is one of the most popular and well-documented game frameworks, with thousands of public examples and tutorials.[2, 10] This vast public code corpus serves as the LLM's training data, making it more "fluent" in Phaser than any other framework. This is not a theoretical advantage; existing research and tools demonstrate that LLMs can and do generate functional Phaser game code, sometimes as their primary output.[11, 12] While its class-based API might seem less modern than component-based alternatives, its clear, hierarchical structure with namespaces like `Phaser.Physics.Arcade` and `Phaser.GameObjects` is highly predictable for an AI to parse and replicate.[3, 13, 14] Optimizing for the AI's existing "knowledge" is the most direct path to reducing bugs and increasing development velocity.

### Animation

*   **GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://gsap.com/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A professional-grade, high-performance JavaScript animation library for creating complex, sequenced animations for UI, SVG, and any JavaScript object property.[15, 16]
    *   **Justification:** GSAP is recommended for its powerful and declarative `Timeline` feature. This allows an AI agent to choreograph complex character animations by defining a sequence of tweens (`.to()`, `.from()`, `.fromTo()`) with precise timing and easing, all within a single, structured object.[16, 17, 18] This approach abstracts away the complexity of managing animation state with `requestAnimationFrame` and manual delta-time calculations. The AI's task is simplified from the error-prone, imperative process of "manage this animation over 60 frames" to the declarative and robust task of "describe the start state, end state, and duration of this animation." GSAP can animate any numeric property of a JavaScript object, making it trivial to integrate with Phaser by targeting a GameObject's properties (e.g., `player.x`, `player.alpha`).[19]

### Sound

*   **Howler.js**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://howlerjs.com/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A lightweight JavaScript audio library for the modern web. It provides a simple API for loading and playing audio, with features like audio sprites, spatial audio, and automatic fallbacks.[20]
    *   **Justification:** Howler.js provides a single, simple, and consistent API that abstracts away the complexities of cross-browser audio implementation.[21, 22] It automatically defaults to the Web Audio API and falls back to HTML5 Audio where necessary, removing an entire class of browser-specific bugs that an LLM would struggle to diagnose and fix.[23] Its built-in support for game-centric features like audio sprites (for playing short sounds from a single file) and spatial audio is accessed through a straightforward API (e.g., `sound.play('laser')`), which is ideal for an AI agent. This constrains the problem space for the "Audio Agent," allowing it to focus on the simple logic of "when event X happens, play sound Y."

### Server-Side Integration

*   **Node.js**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://nodejs.org/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, enabling server-side scripting.[24, 25]
    *   **Justification:** Node.js is the undisputed standard for server-side JavaScript development. Its ubiquity ensures that the LLM has been trained on an immense corpus of Node.js code, maximizing its ability to generate functional and idiomatic backend logic.[26, 27]

*   **Express.js**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://expressjs.com/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building web applications and RESTful APIs.[28, 29]
    *   **Justification:** Express is the de facto standard web framework for Node.js, known for its minimalist and unopinionated nature.[30, 31] This simplicity is a key advantage for an LLM, which can generate standard routing and middleware logic with high accuracy.[32, 33] More complex, opinionated frameworks can introduce "magic" (e.g., complex dependency injection) that is harder for an LLM to reason about. The combination of Node.js and Express represents the path of least resistance and the highest probability of success for automated backend generation.[34, 35]

*   **Socket.IO**
    *   **Official Link:** `https://socket.io/`
    *   **Core Functionality:** A library that enables real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication between web clients and servers.[36, 37]
    *   **Justification:** For any features requiring real-time updates (such as server-side validation of player actions or future multiplayer capabilities), Socket.IO is the industry standard. It provides a reliable connection with automatic fallbacks from WebSockets to HTTP long-polling.[37] Its simple, event-based API (`socket.on('event',...)` and `socket.emit('event',...)`) is highly predictable and easy for an LLM to generate and manage.
