# Game Concept Document: Time Oddity

## Title
**Time Oddity**

## Tone
Mysterious, whimsical, lightly philosophical — inspired by time travel paradoxes and surreal dream logic.

---

## Story

You play as **Echo**, a time-lost traveler stuck in an infinite loop across fragmented timelines. Echo has no memory of where — or when — they come from. All they have is a strange pocketwatch fused into their hand and a distant melody that seems to call from the future. 

The world is breaking apart — bits of time eras blend into each other: dinosaurs roam near flying cars, sundials float above industrial wastelands, and echoes of future cities dissolve into Renaissance forests. Echo must keep moving forward through this unstable time cascade, seeking fragments of their lost identity while avoiding paradoxes that threaten to erase them.

As Echo runs, they collect **"time shards"** — crystallized moments that rebuild pieces of their memory. At regular intervals, Echo encounters **Paradox Zones** — unstable rifts where strange rules apply (reverse gravity, slowed time, doubled enemies). The deeper into the timeline Echo goes, the weirder and more unstable the world becomes — until reaching a singularity where a critical choice must be made.

## Main Character Description

**Name:** Echo  
**Appearance:**  
- A slender, ageless humanoid figure wrapped in patchwork clothes from different time periods: a Roman belt, a futuristic visor, Victorian boots, tribal armlets.  
- A glowing pocketwatch is embedded in their left palm, ticking erratically.  
- Their silhouette subtly glitches when near Paradox Zones.  
- Animations are smooth but slightly delayed, hinting at their unstable existence.

**Abilities:**  
- **Phase Dash:** A short teleport that leaves a ghost trail — can be used to pass through objects or swap places with temporal echoes.  
- **Chrono Pulse:** Emits a shockwave that freezes nearby hazards or enemies for 1.5 seconds.  
- **Paradox Sync:** When entering a Paradox Zone, Echo can **choose** one of two random "time rules" to apply (e.g., inverted gravity vs. random teleportation). Only one can be selected per zone.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### 1. **Paradox Zones (Dynamic Mutation Layers)**  
At randomized intervals, Echo enters a Paradox Zone — a zone where the physical laws of the game change. Each zone offers a **binary choice** with different gameplay consequences. Examples:

- **Reverse Time** (platforms and enemies rewind briefly)  
- **Split Reality** (Echo duplicated with mirrored controls)  
- **Gravity Inversion** (walk on ceilings)  
- **Slow Motion** (bullet-time effect)  
- **Temporal Echoes** (past versions of Echo repeat actions from 10 seconds ago)

These force the player to adapt constantly, keeping gameplay fresh and unpredictable.

### 2. **Memory Reconstruction (Meta Progression Layer)**  
Each run allows players to collect **Time Shards**. Between runs, these can be used to reconstruct **Echo's fragmented memories**, unlocking visual snippets, environmental changes, and passive upgrades. As more memories are recovered, the infinite loop subtly changes (new tilesets, enemies, music layers) — hinting at an eventual escape or transformation.

## Enemies

### 1. **Loop Hounds**  
- Shadowy beasts with clocks for faces. They speed up as the player collects more shards, embodying the anxiety of time catching up.  
- Vulnerable only when the Chrono Pulse is used.

### 2. **Chrono Leeches**  
- Flying parasites that slow Echo's dash cooldown on contact.  
- They cluster near time shards, forcing risk-reward decisions.

### 3. **The Archivist**  
- A rare miniboss that appears every X shards. Speaks in riddles and paradoxes. Fights are surreal, with logic puzzles embedded into the platforming (e.g., needing to lose on purpose to win).

## Music

**Style:**  
- Ambient glitch-electronic with layers of analog instruments (e.g., music box, bowed saw, old synths)  
- Tempo subtly accelerates the longer you stay alive, increasing tension  
- Each Paradox Zone introduces warped musical effects (e.g., reversed tracks, detuned chords, syncopated rhythms)

**Sound Design Highlights:**  
- Footsteps echo with delay
- Dash creates a resonant time “ping”
- Each time shard has a musical tone — collecting them gradually builds a melody

## Summary

**Time Oddity** blends simple controls with layered, ever-changing mechanics that create a fresh experience every run. The game invites players to interpret a fragmented story through nonlinear memory reveals and gameplay anomalies — making each session not just a challenge, but a piece of a larger narrative puzzle.
