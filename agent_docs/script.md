# **Time Oddity**

## Story
In the quaint town of Pendulum Point, all clocks have suddenly stopped—but people keep *moving* as though time still flows.  
You play as **Tess**, the town’s curious clock-maker’s apprentice who discovers a pocket-watch that can *snip* and *stitch* moments together.  

1. **Act I – The Pause**  
   Tess learns to *pause* local time. Pausing not only freezes hazards but also turns falling debris into temporary platforms.  

2. **Act II – The Echo**  
   Mid-game, Tess unlocks **Time Echoes**: each time she rewinds, a translucent “ghost” of her previous run re-enacts her past actions, allowing cooperative puzzles with her own echo.

3. **Act III – The Fold**  
   Tess realizes the pocket-watch is a fragment of a fractured timeline. By “folding” two distant seconds together, she creates portals that connect non-adjacent spots for a heartbeat.  

4. **Twist & Finale**  
   The true antagonist is Tess’s *future self*, now the enigmatic **Chrono Weaver**, who has been over-repairing time and causing the freeze. In the climax Tess must outwit—and eventually merge with—her older self, restoring a single, healthy timeline.

## Main Character Description
| Trait | Details |
|-------|---------|
| **Name** | Tess Cogsworth |
| **Appearance** | Slim 14-year-old with copper hair in a loose braid, bronze goggles resting on her forehead, and a patchwork vest filled with watch gears that softly tick. |
| **Personality** | Inquisitive, optimistic, prone to tinkering mid-sentence, speaks in quick bursts like she’s racing a clock. |
| **Core Animation Set** | Idle: flips pocket-watch open, gears float around her. Run: slight lean as though chasing seconds. Pause ability: snaps fingers; a ripple freezes nearby sprites. Echo/rewind: spins the watch backward, leaving a shimmering trail. Fold: two-finger “pinch” gesture that tears the air open into a glowing seam. |
| **Unique Abilities** | **Pause** (freeze objects/enemies briefly), **Echo** (record & replay past 5 seconds), **Fold** (create short-lived portals between two marked spots). |

## Enemies
| Enemy | Visual | Behavior | Time Interaction |
|-------|--------|----------|------------------|
| **Second Handers** | Spindly robots with long clock-hand arms that sweep back and forth. | Patrol in semicircles; arms act as rotating blades. | Paused arms become safe bridges; Echo doubles their blades so timing matters. |
| **Hourglass Spectres** | Cloaked sand spirits with torsos shaped like half-emptied hourglasses. | Drip sand projectiles that slow Tess on hit. | Rewind returns spilled sand, canceling the slow; Fold portals let sand pour into other areas, disabling traps. |
| **Chrono Weaver’s Shards** | Floating crystalline shards emitting minute-mark laser grids. | Shift position every few seconds following a rhythmic pattern. | Pause halts the pattern; Echo creates phantom shards requiring Tess to plan two timelines ahead. |

## Music
* **Core Palette**: Warm lo-fi piano, pizzicato strings, and pocket-watch ticks layered over ambient pads.  
* **Dynamic Layers**  
  * **Normal Flow** – Gentle 3⁄4 waltz symbolizing the town’s heartbeat.  
  * **Paused Time** – High-pass-filtered track with muffled bass, evoking breath held.  
  * **Echo Phase** – A counter-melody played backward in faint echo-reverb, swelling each time an echo appears.  
  * **Fold Portals** – Detuned celesta arpeggios panned left/right as the timeline stitches.  
The soundtrack modulates tempo subtly with player speed, reinforcing the sense of bending time.

## Misc Details
* **Visual Style**: Hand-drawn backgrounds with sepia outlines; foreground sprites colored softly except for bright cyan time-effects.  
* **UI**: Clock-face HUD whose hands represent pause cooldown and echo charge.  
* **Accessibility**: One-button mode auto-executes folds, letting casual players enjoy narrative without complex combos.  
* **Easter Eggs**: Hidden “cuckoo eggs” unlock micro-levels parodying famous time tropes (groundhog loops, déjà vu corridors).  
* **Speed-Run Mode**: Disables story cutscenes and reveals a frame-timing overlay, encouraging mastery of pause/echo chaining.  
* **Final Credit Twist**: An epilogue level playable *during* the credits, where Tess writes a postcard to her past self—an endless loop hinting that the cycle may start anew.
