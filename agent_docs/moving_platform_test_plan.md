# Moving Platform Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for moving platform implementation in the Time Oddity project. The plan follows TDD/BDD methodologies as defined in `testing_best_practices.md` and ensures full compliance with project invariants.

## Test Strategy Overview

### Test Pyramid Distribution
- **Unit Tests**: 75% - Fast, isolated tests for core logic
- **Integration Tests**: 20% - Component interaction validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: 5% - Complete workflow validation

### Key Testing Principles
1. **TDD Workflow**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle for all implementations
2. **Mock Strategy**: Use centralized mocks from `tests/mocks/`
3. **Time Reversal Focus**: Critical testing of rewind functionality
4. **Performance Validation**: Ensure <5% performance impact

## Unit Test Plan

### 1. MovingPlatform Entity Tests (`tests/unit/moving-platform.test.js`)

#### Core Functionality Tests
- Initialize with correct default configuration
- Accept custom movement configuration
- Extend Entity class properly
- Configure physics body correctly

#### Movement Pattern Tests
- Implement linear movement correctly
- Implement circular movement correctly  
- Implement path movement correctly
- Handle movement start/stop/reverse

#### Time Reversal Integration Tests
- Implement getStateForRecording
- Implement setStateFromRecording
- Preserve movement state during recording
- Restore movement state accurately

### 2. PlatformMovement System Tests (`tests/unit/platform-movement.test.js`)

#### Movement Calculation Tests
- Calculate linear movement positions
- Calculate circular movement positions
- Calculate path movement positions
- Provide deterministic calculations

## Integration Test Plan

### 1. SceneFactory Integration (`tests/integration/moving-platform-integration.test.js`)

#### Factory Creation Tests
- Create moving platforms from configuration
- Extend SceneFactory with createMovingPlatform method
- Maintain backward compatibility with static platforms

### 2. TimeManager Integration Tests

#### State Recording Integration
- Register moving platform with TimeManager
- Record moving platform state correctly
- Restore moving platform state during rewind

### 3. CollisionManager Integration Tests

#### Moving Platform Collision Tests
- Set up collision between player and moving platform
- Handle player riding on moving platform

## Mock Strategy

### 1. GSAP Mocking
Enhanced GSAP mock for moving platforms with timeline support.

### 2. Phaser Scene Enhancement
Extended scene mock for moving platform specific functionality.

## Performance Test Plan

### 1. Movement Performance Tests
- Maintain 60fps with multiple moving platforms
- Have minimal memory impact

### 2. Time Reversal Performance Tests
- Handle rewind with multiple moving platforms efficiently

## Edge Case Test Plan

### 1. Configuration Edge Cases
- Handle zero speed configuration
- Handle invalid path configurations
- Handle boundary collisions gracefully

### 2. Time Reversal Edge Cases
- Handle rapid start/stop during rewind
- Handle empty state buffer during rewind

## Acceptance Criteria Test Plan

### 1. Functional Acceptance Tests
- Moving platforms move smoothly along configured paths
- Time reversal preserves exact movement state
- Collision detection works with moving platforms

### 2. Technical Acceptance Tests
- All unit tests pass with >95% coverage
- Performance impact <5% vs static platforms
- No regressions in existing functionality

### 3. Architecture Acceptance Tests
- Follows decoupled architecture patterns
- Uses centralized mocking strategies
- Integrates with existing systems seamlessly

## Test Execution Strategy

### 1. TDD Implementation Workflow
1. **Red Phase**: Write failing test for each feature
2. **Green Phase**: Implement minimum code to pass test
3. **Refactor Phase**: Optimize and clean up code

### 2. Continuous Integration
- All tests run on every commit
- Performance benchmarks tracked
- Code coverage reports generated

## Success Metrics

### 1. Coverage Targets
- Unit Test Coverage: >95%
- Integration Test Coverage: >90%
- Branch Coverage: >90%

### 2. Performance Targets
- Test Execution Time: <30 seconds total
- Performance Impact: <5% vs baseline

### 3. Quality Targets
- Zero test flakiness
- All acceptance criteria met
- No regressions introduced
