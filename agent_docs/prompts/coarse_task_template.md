# Task Template: Time Oddity Development

> **Copy this template for each new task. Fill in all sections.**
> **Use the reusable_task_prompt_template.md for execution workflow.**

---

## Task Title
_A concise, descriptive title for the task._

## Objective
_What is the goal? What feature, fix, or improvement is being delivered?_

## Task ID: 
_ID to the specific task (e.g., "Task 4.15")_

## Pre-Implementation Analysis

### Documentation Dependencies
- [ ] **invariants.md sections to review**: _List specific sections (e.g., "ยง17 State Structures", "ยง8 Enemy/Freeze Contract")_
- [ ] **testing_best_practices.md sections to apply**: _List relevant testing strategies (e.g., "GSAP Mocking", "State-Based Testing")_
- [ ] **small_comprehensive_documentation.md sections to reference**: _List technical implementation details (e.g., "ยง7.1 Time Control System", "ยง2.1 Core API")_

### State & Invariant Impact Assessment
- [ ] **Existing states to preserve**: _List all existing state structures that must remain unchanged_
- [ ] **New states/invariants to create**: _If applicable, describe new state structures or invariants_
- [ ] **Time reversal compatibility**: _Confirm how new objects will handle state recording/restoration_

## Implementation Plan

### Integration Points
- **Systems affected**: _List game systems that will be impacted_
- **State machines**: _List any state machines that need updates_
- **External libraries**: _List any third-party libraries that will be used_

## Expected Output
_Describe the observable deliverable or change that should result from this task (e.g., new feature visible in-game, passing tests, console output, etc.)._
