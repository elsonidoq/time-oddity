# Context

You have access to a functional requirements file in @_00_v1_functional_requirements.md and work in progress plan to solve thos functional requirements @06_coarse_plan.md 

1. **@01_blueprint.md ** - This file contains a comprehensive technical blueprint for implementing a parametric procedural cave generation system in Node.js, including a detailed 9-step pipeline architecture, technology stack documentation (ndarray, seedrandom, flood-fill, pathfinding), and JSON output formatting specifications for generating game levels.
2. **@testing_best_practices.md ** - Defines TDD/BDD methodologies, testing strategies, and LLM-assisted development workflows  
4. ** @available_tiles.md **: Contains the list of available tiles
5. ** @coarse_task_template.md  ** : Tasks are expected to follow this format
6. ** @04_comprehensive_documentation.md ** Provides a comprehensive documentation required to guide the engineer LLM on using the tech stack

# âœ… Plan Requirements

The plan must adhere to the following principles:

1. **Goal-Driven**  
   - Every task must contribute directly to achieving the product outcomes described in @_00_v1_functional_requirements.md.

2. **Functional Validation at Every Step**:
   - The plan must support **incremental development**, meaning each step should preserve or improve functional correctness.
   - After each task is completed, there must be a **clear, defined way to validate its functionality** through test cases AND observable game behavior if aplicable, or any evidence to the user to verify the correctness of what was coded.

3. **Mandatory Documentation**  
   - Every task must explicitly update:
     - `agent_docs/level_creation_interfaces_and_invariants.md`
   - Documentation must cover:
     - Design decisions
     - Modified or introduced interfaces
     - Invariants maintained

4. **Executing the whole plan achieves the functionality specified in @_00_v1_functional_requirements.md **

Task: 
Audit critically the plan and surface any issues that might hinder the development of the cave level generator.

With the audit result, revisit the tasks in the plan in @06_coarse_plan.md  to make sure following the plan will implement what is described in @_00_v1_functional_requirements.md 

Add, remove, modify or break any tasks to ensure that goal. Place the new plan into the file `agent_docs/level-creation/06_bis_revisited_coarse_plan.md`

Tasks properties:
   - Can be executed sequentially
   - Use the format defined in ` @coarse_task_template.md `
   - Have a clear start and end
