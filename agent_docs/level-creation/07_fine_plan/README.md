## Executive Summary

This fine-grained implementation plan transforms the coarse-grained plan (CG-01 through CG-10) into 42 atomic, executable tasks organized across 4 sequential phases. Each task follows the standardized task template format and is designed to be implementable by an engineer LLM with minimal risk and maximum clarity.

### Key Planning Principles Applied
- **Atomic Tasks**: Each task addresses a single concern and can be completed independently
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Tasks are ordered to support incremental development
- **Continuous Testing**: Every task includes comprehensive test requirements
- **Documentation First**: All tasks mandate documentation updates
- **Risk Mitigation**: Each task includes risk assessment and fallback strategies

## Task Structure and Standards

### Task Template Compliance
Every task strictly follows the format defined in `@task_template.md`:
- **Pre-Implementation Analysis**: Documentation dependencies and state impact assessment
- **Implementation Plan**: Files to change, integration points, testing strategy
- **Task Breakdown**: Atomic acceptance criteria
- **Expected Output**: Observable deliverables
- **Risk Assessment**: Complexity, dependencies, fallback plans
- **Definition of Done**: Comprehensive completion criteria

### Testing Requirements
Each task mandates:
- **Unit Tests**: For all core functions and algorithms
- **Integration Tests**: For component interactions
- **Validation Tests**: For output correctness and format compliance
- **Performance Tests**: Where applicable for generation speed and memory usage

### Documentation Requirements
Every task must update:
- **level_creation_interfaces_and_invariants.md**: All interface changes and design decisions
- **API Documentation**: For all public functions and classes
- **Usage Examples**: Demonstrating task deliverables
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: For common issues and solutions

## Implementation Guidelines

### Sequential Execution
Tasks must be executed in the specified order within each phase:
1. Complete all tasks in Phase 1 before proceeding to Phase 2
2. Each task builds upon the deliverables of previous tasks
3. Integration points are carefully designed to minimize cross-task dependencies

### Quality Gates
Each phase includes quality gates that must be met before proceeding:
- **Functional Completeness**: All specified features working as designed
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing with no failing tests
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Generation times within acceptable limits
- **Documentation Currency**: All documentation updated and accurate

### Risk Mitigation Strategies
- **Incremental Development**: Each task produces testable deliverables
- **Fallback Plans**: Every task includes alternative approaches
- **Continuous Validation**: Regular testing prevents integration issues
- **Modular Architecture**: Components can be developed and tested independently

## Success Metrics

### Functional Requirements Compliance
All requirements from `@_00_v1_functional_requirements.md` must be met:
- [ ] Player spawns over the floor in safe location
- [ ] Goal is reachable from player spawn position
- [ ] All coins are collectible through valid paths
- [ ] Floating and moving platforms ensure level playability
- [ ] Tiles maintain visual consistency and proper edge/corner usage
- [ ] All decorative tiles are properly grounded (no floating elements)

### Performance Targets
- **Generation Time**: < 10 seconds for 100x60 grid levels
- **Memory Usage**: Stable throughout generation process
- **Scalability**: Performance scales appropriately with level size
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate for valid parameter configurations

### Quality Standards
- **Code Coverage**: > 90% for all core algorithms
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% pass rate for all test suites
- **Documentation Coverage**: All public interfaces documented
- **Format Compliance**: 100% compliance with level format specification

## Integration with Game Engine

### Compatibility Requirements
Generated levels must be fully compatible with existing game systems:
- **Level Format**: Strict adherence to `@level-format.md` specification
- **Physics Integration**: All platforms and entities work with game physics
- **Time Reversal**: All generated content supports time manipulation mechanics
- **Performance**: No impact on game runtime performance

### Validation Process
Multi-stage validation ensures game compatibility:
1. **Schema Validation**: JSON output matches format specification exactly
2. **Content Validation**: All entities are properly configured
3. **Game Loading Test**: Generated levels load successfully in game engine
4. **Functionality Test**: All gameplay features work as expected
