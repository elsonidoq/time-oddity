```javascript
placePlatforms(player, grid, target = 0.85)
// platforms = []
// reachable = get all reachable tiles from player position
// while len(reachable) / len(grid) < target:
//     grid_with_platforms = copy the grid and mark all tiles occupied by a platform as wall tiles
//     before_reachable = get all reachable tiles from player position
//     ring = criticalRing(player, grid)
//     tile = sample one tile from the ring
//
//     platform_type = multinomial_choice({'floating': 0.4, 'moving': 0.6}) // 40% probability of sampling a floating platform
//     if platform_type == 'floating':
//         S = sample a platform size
//         platform = floating_platform(position=tile, size=S)
//     elif platform_type == 'moving':
//         raise NotImplemented()
//
//     grid_with_platforms = copy the grid 
//     grid.mark_as_walls(platform.get_occupied_tiles()) // for floating platforms are (tile.x, tile.y), (tile.x + 1, tile.y), ..., (tile.x + S, tile.y)
//     after_reachable = get all reachable tiles from player position
//     if len(after_reachable) > len(before_reachable) // only if it improves
//         platforms.append(platform)
//     reachable = after_reachable
```

#### Guidelines
