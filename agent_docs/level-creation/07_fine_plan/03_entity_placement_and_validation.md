//     grid_with_platforms = copy the grid and mark all tiles occupied by a platform as wall tiles
//     before_reachable = get all reachable tiles from player position
//     ring = criticalRing(player, grid)
//     tile = sample one tile from the ring
//     S = sample a platform size
//     platforms.append(new platform starting in tile, with size S)
