## Critical Success Criteria

### ALL Functional Requirements Must Be Met:
1. **Player spawns over the floor** - Validated in Task CG-04 with safety checks
2. **Goal is reachable from player spawn position** - Validated in Task CG-04 with multiple path verification
3. **All coins are collectible** - Validated in Task CG-07 with comprehensive pathfinding validation
4. **All coins and the goal are not placed inside another colliding block** - Validated in Tasks CG-05, CG-07 with comprehensive collision detection
5. **Floating and moving platforms are used to make sure the game is playable** - Validated in Task CG-09 with physics constraints
6. **Tiles are coherently used maintaining a visual consistency** - Validated in Task CG-06 with comprehensive visual validation
7. **Tiles are correctly used so that edges and corners use proper suffixes** - Validated in Task CG-06 with suffix enforcement
8. **All decorative tiles are properly over the ground** - Validated in Task CG-06 with ground attachment validation

### Performance Requirements:
- **Generation Time**: <10 seconds for 100x60 grid levels with optimization
- **Memory Usage**: Stable throughout generation process with leak detection
- **Scalability**: Performance scales appropriately with level size with benchmarking
- **Reliability**: 100% success rate for valid parameter configurations

### Quality Standards:
- **Code Coverage**: >95% for all core algorithms
- **Test Success Rate**: 100% pass rate for all test suites
- **Documentation Coverage**: All interfaces documented in level_creation_interfaces_and_invariants.md
- **Format Compliance**: 100% compliance with level format specification
- **Visual Quality**: Generated levels meet visual quality standards with regression testing

This enhanced plan ensures that every functional requirement is explicitly addressed, validated, and tested, while maintaining architectural integrity, performance requirements, and comprehensive error handling throughout the system.
