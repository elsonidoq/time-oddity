## 7. System Invariants

### 7.1 Data Flow Invariants

- **FLOW-1**: Grid objects are passed by reference to avoid copying
- **FLOW-2**: Each pipeline step validates its inputs
- **FLOW-3**: Error conditions propagate up the call stack
- **FLOW-4**: Memory is managed efficiently throughout pipeline
- **FLOW-5**: Deterministic behavior is maintained across all steps

### 7.2 State Management Invariants

- **STATE-1**: RNG state is isolated per instance
- **STATE-2**: Grid modifications are controlled and validated
- **STATE-3**: Configuration objects are immutable after validation
- **STATE-4**: Performance metrics are accumulated correctly
- **STATE-5**: Log state is preserved across operations

### 7.3 Thread Safety Invariants

- **THREAD-1**: All components are stateless where possible
- **THREAD-2**: Shared state is properly synchronized
- **THREAD-3**: RNG instances are thread-local
- **THREAD-4**: Grid operations are atomic
- **THREAD-5**: Error handling is thread-safe

### 7.4 Memory Management Invariants

- **MEMORY-1**: Large grids use TypedArray for efficiency
- **MEMORY-2**: Views are used instead of copies where possible
- **MEMORY-3**: Memory leaks are prevented through proper cleanup
- **MEMORY-4**: Grid dimensions are validated before allocation
- **MEMORY-5**: Memory usage is monitored and reported
