# Level Creation Interfaces and Invariants

This document defines all interfaces, invariants, and contracts for the Time Oddity cave generation system. It serves as the authoritative reference for all implemented functionality and must be updated whenever new components are added or existing ones are modified.

## Table of Contents

1. [Core System Interfaces](01_core_system_interfaces.md) - RandomGenerator and GridUtilities interfaces for foundational operations
2. [Generation Pipeline Interfaces](02_generation_pipeline_interfaces.md) - GridSeeder and CellularAutomata for cave generation algorithms
3. [Analysis and Validation Interfaces](03_analysis_and_validation_interfaces.md) - Region detection, corridor carving, quality validation, physics-aware reachability analysis, and comprehensive solvability testing systems
4. [Placement and Pathfinding Interfaces](04_placement_and_pathfinding_interfaces.md) - Player spawn, goal placement, and A* pathfinding integration
5. [Visualization and Monitoring Interfaces](05_visualization_and_monitoring_interfaces.md) - ASCII visualization, performance monitoring, and logging systems
6. [CLI and Integration Interfaces](06_cli_and_integration_interfaces.md) - Command-line interface and integration contracts
7. [System Invariants](07_system_invariants.md) - Data flow, state management, thread safety, and memory management invariants
8. [Performance and Error Handling Contracts](08_contracts.md) - Time/space complexity, performance benchmarks, error handling, and integration contracts
