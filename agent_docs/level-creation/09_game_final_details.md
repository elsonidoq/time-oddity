## Implementation Order and Dependencies

### Phase 1: Core Systems (Tasks 1.1-1.2, 2.1-2.2)
- **Task 1.1**: Player invulnerability system (foundation)
- **Task 1.2**: Blinking visual effect (depends on 1.1)
- **Task 2.1**: Game Over scene (independent)
- **Task 2.2**: Death event handling (depends on 2.1)

### Phase 2: Time Reversal Compatibility (Tasks 3.1-3.2)
- **Task 3.1**: Health time reversal (depends on 1.1)
- **Task 3.2**: Death state time reversal (depends on 2.2, 3.1)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Visual Effects (Tasks 4.1-4.2)
- **Task 4.1**: Red overlay (independent)
- **Task 4.2**: Enhanced effects (depends on 4.1)

### Phase 4: Tile Rendering Fixes (Task 5.1)
- **Task 5.1**: Enable pixel art mode and fix all tile rendering issues (independent)

## Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
1. **Player damage immunity works correctly** with 2-second invulnerability and blinking effect
2. **Death system functions properly** with Game Over scene and restart/menu options
3. **Time reversal affects health and death** - rewinding past damage/death restores health and dismisses Game Over
4. **Enhanced time reversal effects** include red overlay and additional visual/sound effects
5. **Tile rendering is fixed** with pixel art mode enabled, maintaining zoom = 0.5 for good visibility while fixing transparency and gaps between blocks
6. **All tests pass** and no regressions are introduced
7. **Documentation is updated** in invariants.md to reflect new states and behaviors

## Risk Mitigation

- **Incremental implementation**: Each task can be implemented and tested independently
- **Comprehensive testing**: Each task includes unit and integration tests
- **Fallback plans**: Each task has defined fallback approaches if primary implementation fails
- **Documentation updates**: All changes are documented in invariants.md
- **Regression testing**: Full test suite runs after each task completion

This plan provides a clear, sequential path to implementing all required features while maintaining system stability and test coverage.

## Task 6: Replace Camera Zoom with Centralized Sprite Scaling

### Task 6.1: Implement Centralized Sprite Scaling System

**Objective**: Replace the camera zoom system (`this.cameras.main.setZoom(0.25)`) with a centralized sprite scaling system that propagates a single scale value to all game entities, eliminating camera zoom glitches while maintaining the same visual appearance and gameplay functionality. 

**Architectural requirement**: The whole scale value of the level must be centralized and propagate through all the tiles, so that modifying the scale of the level is only modifying one number in the code.

**Task ID**: Task 6.1

**Pre-Implementation Analysis**:
- [x] **invariants.md sections to review**: ยง2 Phaser Game Configuration, ยง3 Scene Lifecycle, ยง6 Player Invariants, ยง13 Level/Platform Geometry, ยง15 Asset & Animation Keys, ยง18.3 Player State

- **State machines**: None
- **External libraries**: None

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Test files to create/update**: `tests/unit/centralized-scaling-system.test.js`, `tests/integration/scaling-time-reversal.test.js`, `tests/unit/camera-follow.test.js`

  11. Moving platforms work correctly with scaled sprites
  12. Goal tiles work correctly with scaled sprites
- **Mock requirements**: Use existing `phaserSceneMock`, `phaserKeyMock`, and entity mocks

**Task Breakdown & Acceptance Criteria**:

**Phase 1: Create Centralized Scale Configuration**

- [ ] Define `LEVEL_SCALE` constant (default: 0.25) as the single source of truth
- [ ] Export scale configuration for use across the application

- [ ] Update Player constructor to use centralized scale
- [ ] Update Enemy constructor to use centralized scale
- [ ] Update Coin constructor to use centralized scale
- [ ] Update MovingPlatform constructor to use centralized scale
- [ ] Update GoalTile constructor to use centralized scale
- [ ] Ensure all platform sprites use centralized scale

**Expected Output**: All game objects appear at the same visual size as before (equivalent to 0.25 camera zoom) but are achieved through centralized sprite scaling instead of camera zoom, eliminating camera zoom glitches while maintaining all existing gameplay functionality. Modifying the scale value in one place (GameConfig.js) changes the scale of all game entities.

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Potential complexity**: Medium - affects multiple systems and requires careful coordination
- **Dependencies**: Existing entity creation systems, TimeManager, CollisionManager
- **Fallback plan**: Revert to camera zoom if centralized scaling causes issues

**Definition of Done**:
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Expected output is achieved and verified
- [ ] All project tests pass (locally and in CI)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] **invariants.md updated with centralized scaling system**
- [ ] No new linter or type errors
- [ ] No regressions in related features
- [ ] Camera zoom glitches are eliminated
- [ ] All gameplay functionality preserved
- [ ] **Centralized scale requirement**: Modifying scale in one place (GameConfig.js) changes all entities

**Technical Implementation Details**:

**Centralized Scale Configuration**:
```javascript
// client/src/config/GameConfig.js
export const LEVEL_SCALE = 0.25; // Single source of truth for level scaling
export const GAME_CONFIG = {
  levelScale: LEVEL_SCALE,
  // Other game configuration...
};
```

**Scale Propagation Pattern**:
- All entity constructors import scale from GameConfig
- SceneFactory uses centralized scale for all sprite creation
- Scale value is applied consistently across all game entities
- Single point of modification for entire level scale

**Affected Entities**: Player, Enemy, Coin, Platform sprites, MovingPlatform, GoalTile
**State Recording**: Scale values must be included in TimeManager's TemporalState
**Collision Detection**: Physics bodies must be scaled proportionally
**Performance**: Individual scaling may have slight performance impact but eliminates camera zoom glitches

**Integration Points**:
1. **GameConfig โ All Entities**: Centralized scale configuration
2. **GameScene โ Camera**: Remove zoom, maintain follow and bounds
3. **SceneFactory โ Scale Propagation**: Apply centralized scale to all sprite creation
4. **TimeManager โ Scale State**: Include scale in state recording/restoration
5. **CollisionManager โ Scaled Bodies**: Ensure collision detection works with scaled sprites

**Testing Strategy**:
- **Unit Tests**: Test centralized scale configuration and propagation
- **Integration Tests**: Test full gameplay scenarios with scaled sprites
- **Visual Tests**: Verify visual appearance matches previous camera zoom
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure no significant performance degradation
- **Centralization Tests**: Verify scale modification in one place affects all entities

**Success Criteria**:
1. **Centralized Configuration**: Single scale value controls all entities
2. **Visual Consistency**: All sprites appear at the same size as before
3. **Functionality Preservation**: All gameplay mechanics work correctly
4. **Time Reversal Compatibility**: Scale values are preserved during rewind
5. **Collision Accuracy**: All collision detection works with scaled sprites
6. **Performance**: No significant performance impact
7. **Glitch Elimination**: Camera zoom glitches are completely eliminated
8. **Maintainability**: Scale can be modified in one place (GameConfig.js)
