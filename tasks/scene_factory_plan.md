# SceneFactory Refactor Plan: Configuration-Driven Level Generation

## Executive Summary

This plan implements a **safe, incremental refactor** to replace hardcoded platform creation in `GameScene` with a clean, configuration-driven `SceneFactory` abstraction. The refactor preserves all existing functionality while enabling future support for large, configurable levels.

## Design Analysis

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Hardcoded platform creation** in `GameScene.create()` method
- **Tight coupling** between scene logic and level layout
- **Limited extensibility** for new platform types (e.g., moving platforms)
- **Poor testability** of level generation logic

### Target Architecture
- **SceneFactory** as a pure logic class (following Humble Object pattern)
- **Configuration-driven** level generation from JSON data
- **Decoupled responsibilities** between scene management and level creation
- **Extensible platform system** supporting static, moving, and future platform types

### Key Invariants to Preserve
1. **Platform Physics Groups**: `this.platforms` must remain a Phaser physics group
2. **Platform Configuration**: `configurePlatform()` method must continue to work
3. **Ground Level**: Ground top at y=656 is critical for player spawn and camera bounds
4. **Tile Assets**: Kenney tile atlas keys must remain valid
5. **Collision System**: CollisionManager expects platforms group to exist

## Phase 1: Refactor Foundation (No Feature Changes)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive testing**: Extensive test coverage for all new functionality
- **Incremental development**: Each task builds on previous stable foundation
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation if new features fail
- **Performance monitoring**: Continuous performance testing throughout development

### Rollback Plan
If significant issues arise during development:

3. **Complete rollback**: Revert to pre-refactor state if necessary

## Conclusion

This refactor plan provides a safe, incremental path to replacing hardcoded platform creation with a configuration-driven SceneFactory. The two-phase approach ensures that existing functionality is preserved while enabling future extensibility for large, complex levels.

The plan follows established best practices for decoupled architecture, comprehensive testing, and incremental development. Each task is atomic, testable, and builds on the previous stable foundation.

Upon completion, the system will be more maintainable, testable, and scalable while preserving all existing game functionality and enabling future enhancements.
