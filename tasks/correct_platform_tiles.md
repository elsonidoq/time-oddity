# Platform Tile Rendering Refactor: Implementation Plan

## üéØ Objective
Refactor the platform rendering logic to correctly apply tile assets based on platform size (single-block vs. multi-block) using the proper tile naming convention. **Backward compatibility is not required; all upgraded objects must use the new tilePrefix format.**

## üìã Current State Analysis

### Current Implementation Issues
1. **Single Tile Usage**: All platforms use the same tile (`${tileKey}.png`) regardless of size or position
2. **Missing Visual Distinction**: Multi-block platforms don't visually indicate their structure (left/middle/right tiles)
3. **Inconsistent Naming**: Current implementation doesn't leverage the available tile variants

### Available Tile Assets (from `available_tiles.md`)
- **Block Tiles**: `terrain_grass_block_center`, `terrain_grass_block_left`, `terrain_grass_block_right`
- **Horizontal Tiles**: `terrain_grass_horizontal_left`, `terrain_grass_horizontal_middle`, `terrain_grass_horizontal_right`

### Target Naming Convention
- **Single-block platform**: Use `${tilePrefix}.png` (e.g., `terrain_grass_block_center`)
- **Multi-block platform**: 
  - Left tile: `${tilePrefix}_left.png` (e.g., `terrain_grass_block_left`)
  - Middle tiles: `${tilePrefix}_middle.png` (e.g., `terrain_grass_block_center`)
  - Right tile: `${tilePrefix}_right.png` (e.g., `terrain_grass_block_right`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Tile Selection Logic (Foundation)

#### Task 1.1: Create Tile Selection Utility
**Objective**: Implement a utility function that determines the correct tile key based on platform position and size.

**Files to Modify**:
- **Create**: `client/src/systems/TileSelector.js` - New utility class for tile selection logic

**Implementation Details**:
- Create `TileSelector` class with static methods for tile selection
- Implement `getTileKey(tilePrefix, position, totalTiles, tileIndex)` method
- Support both block-style (`_left`, `_center`, `_right`) and horizontal-style (`_left`, `_middle`, `_right`) naming
- Handle edge cases (single tile, two tiles, many tiles)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Unit tests for all tile selection scenarios
- Edge case testing (single tile, two tiles, many tiles)
- Validation of tile key generation for different tile prefixes

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [x] `TileSelector` class created with proper tile selection logic
- [x] Unit tests pass for all tile selection scenarios
- [x] Handles both block and horizontal tile naming conventions
- [x] Returns valid tile keys for all position/size combinations

**User Feedback**:

**User Feedback**:
- [x] After implementation, request user feedback to check the integration and test-level.json changes.

### Phase 3: Configuration and Documentation Updates

#### Task 3.2: Update Level Format Documentation
**Objective**: Update documentation to reflect the new tile prefix system and removal of backward compatibility.

**Files to Modify**:
- **Modify**: `agent_docs/level-creation/level-format.md` - Update documentation
- **Modify**: `agent_docs/invariants.md` (if needed) - Update invariants for new format

**Implementation Details**:
- Add section explaining tile prefix system and new required format
- Update examples to use tile prefixes instead of specific tile keys
- Document the automatic tile selection behavior

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Potential Risks
1. **Breaking Changes**: Modifying platform creation could break existing functionality for non-upgraded objects
2. **Performance Impact**: Additional tile selection logic could impact performance
3. **Visual Inconsistencies**: New tile system might create visual artifacts
4. **Configuration Compatibility**: Existing level configurations must be updated for upgraded objects

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Each task is independently testable
2. **No Backward Compatibility**: All upgraded objects must use the new format
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive testing at each phase
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor rendering performance throughout implementation
5. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation in sync with implementation

## üìù Notes

- This implementation **removes backward compatibility** for upgraded objects; all must use the new tilePrefix format
- The tile selection logic is designed to be extensible for future tile types
- All changes are incremental and independently testable
- Performance impact should be minimal as tile selection is a simple string operation
- The implementation follows the existing architectural patterns in the codebase
