# Phase 3.bis: Refactor Test Suite for Best Practices

**Instructions:**
- Complete each task in the order listed below. Do not start a new task until the previous one is fully completed, committed, and all changes are stable.
- The test suite is currently not fully passing; this sequence is designed to systematically resolve all issues. After each task, ensure that no new test failures are introduced and that progress is made toward a fully passing suite. Only the final task requires all project tests to pass.
- Each task is self-contained and provides all necessary context for execution by an engineering LLM or developer.
- After each task, verify the project is stable before proceeding.

## Task 7: Refactor Scene and Entity Constructors for Testability (Mock Injection)

### Objective
Refactor the constructors of `BaseScene`, `GameScene`, `Entity`, and `Player` to accept an optional `mockScene` parameter. Update all affected tests to pass the centralized mock scene from `tests/mocks/phaserMock.js`. This ensures all scene/physics references (including nested ones set in super() calls) are correctly mocked, fully resolving persistent errors like `this.scene.physics.add.collider is not a function` and enabling reliable, maintainable test execution.

### Documentation References
- [x] `comprehensive_documentation.md`: Testing and Mocking (Mocking External Libraries, Best Practices for Testability)
- [x] This task is created in response to persistent issues in phase 3.bis test refactor

### Pre-Implementation Design & Impact
- **Files/Classes to Change:**
  - `client/src/scenes/BaseScene.js`
  - `client/src/scenes/GameScene.js`
  - `client/src/entities/Entity.js`
  - `client/src/entities/Player.js`
  - All affected test files (notably those instantiating scenes/entities directly)
- **Integration Points:**
  - Scene and entity instantiation in tests
  - All code paths that rely on `this.scene`, `this.physics`, etc.
- **Mocking/Test Setup:**
  - Centralized mock from `tests/mocks/phaserMock.js` will be passed as a constructor argument in tests
- **Potential Risks/Complexity:**
  - Refactoring constructors may require updating all instantiations in both source and test code
  - Risk of missing a test or code path that instantiates without the mock

### TDD Test Plan
- **Test Files to Create/Update:**
  - All test files that instantiate scenes/entities (e.g., `game-scene.test.js`, `game-scene-physics-fix.test.js`, `world-boundaries.test.js`, `player-statemachine-integration.test.js`)
- **Test Cases:**
  - All existing tests must pass with the new constructor signature
  - Edge case: instantiating without a mock should still work in production code
- **Test Data/Mocks Needed:**
  - Centralized mock scene from `tests/mocks/phaserMock.js`

### Task Breakdown & Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Refactor constructors of `BaseScene`, `GameScene`, `Entity`, and `Player` to accept an optional `mockScene` parameter
- [ ] Update all affected test files to pass the mock scene when instantiating these classes
- [ ] Remove unnecessary patching of scene/physics references in test setup
- [ ] All tests pass with no persistent mocking errors

### Expected Output
- All tests pass reliably with no `this.scene.physics.add.collider is not a function` or similar errors
- All scene/entity instantiations in tests use the centralized mock
- No unnecessary patching or workarounds remain in test setup

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Expected output is achieved and verified
- [ ] All project tests pass (locally and in CI)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (including Testing and Mocking section if relevant)
- [ ] No new linter or type errors
- [ ] No regressions in related features
- [ ] Task marked as complete in tracking system
- [ ] **Task is marked as completed in the relevant tracking file (e.g., by updating the checkbox or adding a completion note in the phase/task file)**

### Git Handling
- [ ] All changes are committed with clear, descriptive messages
- [ ] Changes are pushed to the correct feature branch (specify branch name if needed)
- [ ] Branch is up to date with main/develop before merge
- [ ] Pull request created and linked to task (if applicable)

### Post-Mortem / Retrospective (fill in if needed)
- _If this task caused test breakage, required significant rework, or revealed process gaps, document what happened and how to avoid it in the future._

## Task 8: Fix Time Reversion Bug - Player Movement After Rewind

**Prerequisite:** Task 7 must be fully completed and all changes must be stable before starting this task.

### Objective
Fix the bug where the player starts walking after releasing the R key (time reversion) until an arrow key is pressed. The issue occurs because the player's state machine doesn't properly handle the transition from rewind mode back to normal gameplay.

### Documentation References
- [x] `comprehensive_documentation.md`: Section 7.1 "The Time Control System: A Deep Dive"
- [x] `comprehensive_documentation.md`: Section 7.2 "Player State Machine Definition"
- [x] This task addresses a regression introduced during the refactor in Task 7

### Pre-Implementation Design & Impact
- **Files/Classes to Change:**
  - `client/src/entities/Player.js` - Update the update method to properly handle post-rewind state transitions
  - `client/src/systems/TimeManager.js` - May need to add a callback or event when rewind ends
  - `client/src/entities/states/IdleState.js` - May need to ensure proper idle state handling
  - `client/src/entities/states/RunState.js` - May need to ensure proper run state handling
- **Integration Points:**
  - Player state machine transitions
  - TimeManager rewind state management
  - InputManager state detection
- **Mocking/Test Setup:**
  - Need to test rewind start/stop scenarios
  - Need to verify state machine transitions after rewind
- **Potential Risks/Complexity:**
  - Risk of breaking existing rewind functionality
  - Need to ensure state machine properly handles all edge cases

### TDD Test Plan
- **Test Files to Create/Update:**
  - `tests/unit/player-statemachine-integration.test.js` - Add tests for rewind state transitions
  - `tests/unit/time-manager.test.js` - Add tests for rewind end callbacks
  - `tests/unit/game-scene.test.js` - Add integration tests for rewind behavior
- **Test Cases:**
  - Player should transition to idle state when rewind ends and no movement keys are pressed
  - Player should transition to run state when rewind ends and movement keys are pressed
  - Player should not get stuck in walking state after rewind
  - Rewind should not interfere with normal state machine operation
- **Test Data/Mocks Needed:**
  - Mock input states for various scenarios
  - Mock time manager rewind states

### Task Breakdown & Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Identify the root cause of the player movement bug after rewind
- [ ] Implement proper state machine update after rewind ends
- [ ] Add tests to verify the fix works correctly
- [ ] Ensure no regressions in existing rewind functionality
- [ ] Verify the player behaves correctly in all rewind scenarios

### Expected Output
- Player stops moving immediately when rewind ends and no movement keys are pressed
- Player moves correctly when rewind ends and movement keys are pressed
- No unintended movement occurs after rewind
- All existing rewind functionality continues to work correctly

### Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met
- [ ] Expected output is achieved and verified
- [ ] All project tests pass (locally and in CI)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Documentation updated (if relevant)
- [ ] No new linter or type errors
- [ ] No regressions in related features
- [ ] Task marked as complete in tracking system
- [ ] **Task is marked as completed in the relevant tracking file (e.g., by updating the checkbox or adding a completion note in the phase/task file)**
