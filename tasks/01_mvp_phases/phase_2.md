4. **FOURTH**: Implement functionality until all tests pass (Green phase)
5. **FIFTH**: Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
- **CRITICAL**: All collectible coin tests MUST pass before proceeding
- **Expected output**: The GameScene should now contain collectible coins scattered throughout the level. These coins should be visible as animated sprites. When the player touches a coin, the coin sprite should be destroyed and disappear. More advanced feedback (sounds, score) will be added in later phases (Tasks 4.18 and 5.22).
- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after ALL project tests pass
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-11 - Basic coin collectible created and integrated.
- **CRITICAL**: After completion, all changes must be committed to git and pushed to the remote repository.

**Phase 2 Completion**: Merge `feature/phase-2-player-movement` into `main`
