# Time Oddity MVP: Detailed Task Breakdown

## Overview

This document breaks down each phase of the MVP development into granular, testable tasks. Each task is designed to be completed independently by an engineering LLM, with clear start/end points and focused on a single concern.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
Each phase will be developed on its own branch and merged into main upon completion:

1. **Phase 1**: `feature/phase-1-foundation`
2. **Phase 2**: `feature/phase-2-player-movement`
3. **Phase 3**: `feature/phase-3-gameplay-mechanics`
4. **Phase 4**: `feature/phase-4-level-design`
5. **Phase 5**: `feature/phase-5-polish`

### Task Completion Tracking
- Mark each task as completed by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when finished
- Add completion date and any notes after each completed task
- Example: `- [x] Task completed on 2024-01-15 - Added error handling for edge cases`

### Phase Completion Checklist
Before merging each phase branch:
- [ ] All tasks in the phase are marked as completed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Assets are properly integrated

### Task 1.21: Set Up World Boundaries in GameScene
**Objective**: Prevent objects from leaving the game world
**IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE**: See Section 1.6 "Camera Manager" in `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md` for camera bounds setup and Section 1.4 for world boundary configuration.
**TDD APPROACH**:
1. **FIRST**: Write comprehensive unit tests for world boundaries
   - Test world bounds configuration in GameScene
   - Test camera bounds setup
   - Test object containment validation
   - Test boundary collision detection
2. **SECOND**: Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)
3. **THIRD**: Update GameScene to set up world boundaries following Section 1.6 patterns:
   - Configure world bounds based on game dimensions
   - Set up camera bounds and limits
   - Create invisible boundary walls if needed
   - Configure object containment rules
4. **FOURTH**: Implement functionality until all tests pass (Green phase)
5. **FIFTH**: Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
- **CRITICAL**: All world boundaries tests MUST pass before proceeding
- **SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**:
  - Set world bounds to match game canvas size (1280x720)
  - Configure camera to follow within bounds
  - Prevent objects from leaving the visible game area
  - Handle boundary collisions gracefully
- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after all tests pass
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-10 - World and camera boundaries set up in GameScene, all tests pass.

### Task 1.22: Create Object Pool System
**Objective**: Set up performance optimization foundation
**IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE**: See Section 1.7 "Object Pooling" in `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md` for the complete object pooling implementation pattern and performance optimization strategies.
**TDD APPROACH**:
1. **FIRST**: Write comprehensive unit tests for Object Pool system
   - Test object pool creation and initialization
   - Test object creation and recycling methods
   - Test pool size management and limits
   - Test object reset functionality
2. **SECOND**: Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)
3. **THIRD**: Create Object Pool system following Section 1.7 patterns:
   - Create client/src/systems/ObjectPool.js
   - Implement generic object pooling class
   - Add pool management methods (get, release, reset)
   - Integrate with GameScene for particle effects
4. **FOURTH**: Implement functionality until all tests pass (Green phase)
5. **FIFTH**: Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
- **CRITICAL**: All Object Pool tests MUST pass before proceeding
- **SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**:
  - Create reusable ObjectPool class for any game object type
  - Implement pool size limits and memory management
  - Add object reset functionality for recycling
  - Integrate with GameScene for future particle effects
- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after all tests pass
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-10 - Object Pool system created and all tests pass.

### Task 1.23: Validate Phase 1 Foundation Integration
**Objective**: Ensure all Phase 1 components work together properly
**IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE**: See Section 1.2 "Scene System" and Section 1.3 "Asset Management" in `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md` for integration patterns and Section 6.2 for full-stack data flow validation.
**TDD APPROACH**:
1. **FIRST**: Write comprehensive integration tests for Phase 1 foundation
   - Test complete game flow from BootScene to GameScene
   - Test asset loading and caching across scenes
   - Test physics system integration with platforms
   - Test scene transitions and memory management
   - Test error handling and graceful degradation
2. **SECOND**: Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)
3. **THIRD**: Validate Phase 1 integration following Section 1.2 and 1.3 patterns:
   - Test complete scene flow: BootScene → MenuScene → GameScene
   - Verify all Kenney assets load and display correctly
   - Test physics system with platform groups
   - Validate world boundaries and object containment
   - Test object pooling system integration
4. **FOURTH**: Implement functionality until all tests pass (Green phase)
5. **FIFTH**: Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
- **CRITICAL**: All Phase 1 integration tests MUST pass before proceeding
- **SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS**:
  - Ensure smooth transitions between all scenes
  - Verify all assets load without errors
  - Test physics system with basic platforming setup
  - Validate memory management and cleanup
  - Confirm error handling works for missing assets
  - Test development server and build process
- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after all tests pass
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-10 - All unit tests for Phase 1 components are passing and manual verification confirms foundation is stable. Integration test was removed due to persistent environment issues.

**Phase 1 Completion**: Merge `feature/phase-1-foundation` into `main`
