# Time Oddity MVP: Detailed Task Breakdown

## Overview

This document breaks down each phase of the MVP development into granular, testable tasks. Each task is designed to be completed independently by an engineering LLM, with clear start/end points and focused on a single concern.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
Each phase will be developed on its own branch and merged into main upon completion:

1. **Phase 1**: `feature/phase-1-foundation`
2. **Phase 2**: `feature/phase-2-player-movement`
3. **Phase 3**: `feature/phase-3-gameplay-mechanics`
4. **Phase 4**: `feature/phase-4-level-design`
5. **Phase 5**: `feature/phase-5-polish`

### Task Completion Tracking
- Mark each task as completed by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when finished
- Add completion date and any notes after each completed task
- Example: `- [x] Task completed on 2024-01-15 - Added error handling for edge cases`

### Phase Completion Checklist
Before merging each phase branch:
- [ ] All tasks in the phase are marked as completed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Assets are properly integrated

## Phase 3: Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Branch**: `feature/phase-3-gameplay-mechanics`

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: Before implementing any task in this phase, you MUST read the comprehensive documentation file `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md`. This document contains detailed implementation patterns, architectural decisions, and code examples for all systems in this phase. Pay special attention to:
- Section 7.1: The Time Control System (for TimeManager, TemporalState, and rewind mechanics)
- Section 7.2: Platformer Character Controller (for state machine patterns)
- Section 2: High-Performance Animation with GSAP (for visual effects)
- Section 3: Advanced Audio Management with Howler.js (for audio integration)

**TDD REQUIREMENT**: All tasks in this phase follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). You MUST:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests FIRST
2. Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)
3. Implement the minimum functionality to make tests pass (Green phase)
4. Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
5. Only mark task as complete when ALL tests pass

### Task 3.1: Create TimeManager Class
