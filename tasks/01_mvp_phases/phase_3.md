# Time Oddity MVP: Detailed Task Breakdown

## Overview

This document breaks down each phase of the MVP development into granular, testable tasks. Each task is designed to be completed independently by an engineering LLM, with clear start/end points and focused on a single concern.

## Development Workflow

### Branch Management
Each phase will be developed on its own branch and merged into main upon completion:

1. **Phase 1**: `feature/phase-1-foundation`
2. **Phase 2**: `feature/phase-2-player-movement`
3. **Phase 3**: `feature/phase-3-gameplay-mechanics`
4. **Phase 4**: `feature/phase-4-level-design`
5. **Phase 5**: `feature/phase-5-polish`

### Task Completion Tracking
- Mark each task as completed by changing `- [ ]` to `- [x]` when finished
- Add completion date and any notes after each completed task
- Example: `- [x] Task completed on 2024-01-15 - Added error handling for edge cases`

### Phase Completion Checklist
Before merging each phase branch:
- [ ] All tasks in the phase are marked as completed
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
- [ ] Code follows established patterns
- [ ] Assets are properly integrated

## Phase 3: Core Gameplay Mechanics

**Branch**: `feature/phase-3-gameplay-mechanics`

**CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENT**: Before implementing any task in this phase, you MUST read the comprehensive documentation file `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md`. This document contains detailed implementation patterns, architectural decisions, and code examples for all systems in this phase. Pay special attention to:
- Section 7.1: The Time Control System (for TimeManager, TemporalState, and rewind mechanics)
- Section 7.2: Platformer Character Controller (for state machine patterns)
- Section 2: High-Performance Animation with GSAP (for visual effects)
- Section 3: Advanced Audio Management with Howler.js (for audio integration)

**TDD REQUIREMENT**: All tasks in this phase follow Test-Driven Development (TDD). You MUST:
1. Write comprehensive unit tests FIRST
2. Run tests to confirm they fail (Red phase)
3. Implement the minimum functionality to make tests pass (Green phase)
4. Refactor and bugfix until all tests pass (Refactor phase)
5. Only mark task as complete when ALL tests pass

### Task 3.1: Create TimeManager Class
**Objective**: Implement the core time manipulation system
**IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE**: See Section 7.1 "The Time Control System: A Deep Dive" in `agent_docs/comprehensive_documentation.md`.
**TDD APPROACH**:
1.  FIRST: Write unit tests for TimeManager class.
2.  SECOND: Create `client/src/systems/TimeManager.js` to make tests pass.
- **Expected output**: The `TimeManager.js` class file is created in `client/src/systems/`. All associated tests pass. There is no visible change in the game.
- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after ALL project tests pass.
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-11 - Created TimeManager class and initial tests.

- **After completion**: Mark task as completed only after ALL project tests pass.
- **CRITICAL**: After completion, all changes must be committed to git and pushed to the remote repository.
- [x] Completed on 2024-06-11 - Implemented player state recording in TimeManager.

## Task 3.12.bis: Fix Enemy Movement and Physics

### Objective
Fix critical enemy movement and physics issues that prevent enemies from moving properly and cause them to slide frictionless off screen when colliding with the player.

### Documentation References
- [x] Section 1.4 "Physics Bodies" in `comprehensive_documentation.md`
- [x] Section 1.4 "Collision Detection" in `comprehensive_documentation.md`
- [x] **Review and apply all relevant guidance from `testing_best_practices.md` (MANDATORY for all engineering and LLM-driven tasks)**
- [x] Testing and Mocking section for physics testing patterns
- [x] Related to Task 3.12 (LoopHound Enemy) and Task 3.13 (Enemy-Player Collision)

### Root Cause Analysis
**Issue 1: Enemies Do Not Move**
- **Root Cause**: LoopHound constructor disables gravity (`this.body.setGravity(0, 0)`) and sets `setAllowGravity(false)`, but the Enemy base class `configurePhysics()` method re-enables gravity (`setGravity(0, 980)`). This creates a conflict where gravity is enabled but the enemy is positioned incorrectly.
- **Impact**: Enemies fall through platforms or get stuck in physics calculations.

**Issue 2: Enemies Slide Frictionless Off Screen**
- **Root Cause**: No friction or drag is applied to enemy physics bodies. When player collision occurs, enemies maintain their velocity indefinitely without any resistance.
- **Impact**: Enemies slide off screen boundaries and disappear from gameplay.

**Issue 3: Physics Configuration Conflicts**
- **Root Cause**: LoopHound overrides physics settings in constructor, but Enemy base class `configurePhysics()` method applies different settings, creating inconsistent physics behavior.
- **Impact**: Unpredictable enemy movement and collision behavior.

### Pre-Implementation Design & Impact
- **Files/Classes to Change:**
  - `client/src/entities/Enemy.js` - Fix physics configuration conflicts
  - `client/src/entities/enemies/LoopHound.js` - Fix gravity and friction settings

  - World boundary collision system
- **Mocking/Test Setup:**
  - Mock physics body for friction and gravity testing

### Root Cause Analysis
1. **Enemy Access Issue**: ChronoPulse was looking for `this.scene.enemies` but GameScene uses `this.enemies`
2. **Missing Physics Body Methods**: Mock physics body was missing `setDrag` method for enemy tests
3. **Distance Calculation Edge Cases**: Tests had boundary conditions that needed clarification
4. **Integration Testing Gaps**: Missing comprehensive integration tests for the complete workflow

### Implementation Summary

#### Files Modified:
- `client/src/entities/ChronoPulse.js` - Fixed enemy detection and access patterns
- `tests/mocks/phaserMock.js` - Added missing `setDrag` method to physics body mock
- `tests/unit/chrono-pulse.test.js` - Added comprehensive enemy freezing unit tests
- `tests/integration/chrono-pulse-enemy.test.js` - Created new integration test file

#### Key Fixes Applied:

1. **Enhanced Enemy Detection**:

   - Improved error handling for missing or malformed enemy groups
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging

2. **Robust Physics Mocking**:
   - Added `setDrag` method to `createMockBody()` function
