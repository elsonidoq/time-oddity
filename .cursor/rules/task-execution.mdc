You will follow a strict Test Driven Development (TDD) workflow for each task.

1. Begin by writing all required tests as specified in the task description.
2. Once tests are written and the project is in the "red" state (tests failing), proceed to implement the functionality.
3. Focus solely on making the tests pass. Do not refactor or add extra logic beyond what is needed to make the tests pass.
4. After implementation, verify that all newly written tests pass.
5. If the task results in visible or functional changes, prompt the user to manually verify the behavior.
6. Run the full project test suite. Confirm all tests pass (green state).
7. If any test fails:
   - Attempt to fix it silently.
   - If the same error persists after 3 attempts, prompt the user for input or clarification.
