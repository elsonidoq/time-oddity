# Rule: Document all state and invariant changes

Whenever you make changes that affect how **game state is stored or shared**, or that modify **any invariant**, you must:

1. **Update `invariants.md`**  
   - Clearly describe the change.
   - Justify why the invariant or state logic was modified.
   - Include examples if relevant.

2. **Add inline documentation** in the code:  
   - Wherever the modified invariant or shared state is used or changed.
   - Highlight any assumptions future engineers or LLMs must be aware of.

⚠️ This rule is critical: undocumented changes to invariants or shared state may cause regressions that are hard to trace during time-travel, replay, or test execution.

If you're unsure whether something qualifies, **document it anyway**.
