If any test fails:
   - Select a test to work on
   - Perform a root cause analysis to understand the reason why the test fails
   - Attempt to fix it silently.
   - If the same error persists after 3 attempts, prompt the user for input or clarification.

Always use centralized mocks. See `testing_best_practices.md`

Continue fixing tests until all tests are passing or the same error persists after 3 attempts
If there are more tests to fix, do the fixes, do not ask the user
