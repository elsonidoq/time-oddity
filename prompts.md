Now investigate and fully fix the bug where enemies, once respawned via time reversal, are no longer affected by the chrono pulse. Perform all steps autonomously, with no user intervention.

### Step-by-step Instructions:

1. **Formulate Hypothesis**  
   - Analyze code and documentation to understand the expected behavior and the bug.
   - Analyze what invariants are broken, document them in the code and make sure those invariants are not broken anymore
      - To do so, hypothesize the root cause(s) of why respawned enemies are excluded from chrono pulse effects.

2. **Design a Validation Plan**  
   - Outline how you will test your hypothesis.
   - Include checks, conditions, and expected observations to confirm or refute each idea.

3. **Implement a minimal Fix (using TDD)**  
   - Follow the Test-Driven Development process in @task-execution.mdc:
     - Write failing tests that reproduce the issue.
     - Only write the minimum code required to make tests pass.
     - Refactor safely and incrementally if necessary.

4. **Write Complete Test Coverage**  
   - Use @testing_best_practices.md to ensure high-quality, maintainable test coverage for the fix.
   - Include edge cases and regression checks.

### Requirements:
- Be iterative. After each step, document reasoning, decisions, and any dead ends.
- Never skip the testing phase or validations.
- Do not request user input at any point during this task.
- All logs and test results must be stored and referenced in your final summary.
- use @small_comprehensive_documentation.md for reference
- comply  with @task-execution.mdc until step 5: DO NOT RUN THE FULL TEST SUIT 


### Goal:
Deliver a fully working and tested fix with complete test coverage and a documented trail of reasoning and validation steps.

Task: Fix the following game bug â€“ Enemies are not respawning after being killed and then rewinding time.

Instructions:
1. Analyze the codebase to identify the root cause of this issue. Focus specifically on time rewind logic and enemy lifecycle (spawn, kill, respawn).
2. Stablish invariants that sohuld be kept. Analyze the state we are saving for the enemy and make sure it is enough to respawn it.
2. Formulate a clear hypothesis for the cause: the invariant is broken in some part of the process
3. Validate the hypothesis by:
   - Consulting with @small_comprehensive_documentation.md 
   - Consulting the official Phaser 3.87 documentation (@Phaser)
   - Searching for related issues or patterns on the web (@Web)
4. If the hypothesis is invalidated, return to Step 1 with the new insights. Repeat until a valid hypothesis is confirmed.
5. Create a plan to fix the bug based on the validated hypothesis and documentation context following @small_comprehensive_documentation.md . Make sure to add console.logs that can help diagnose in the case the hypothesis is wrong
6. Implement the fix using a strict TDD workflow as outlined in @task-execution.mdc 
7. Use `@testing_best_practices.md` to guide the creation of robust and maintainable test coverage.

Requirements:
- Be iterative and log reasoning for each hypothesis/failure.
- Do not skip testing steps.


Perform an in-depth analysis to determine the root cause. Check @small_comprehensive_documentation.md for reference and create a plan to fix the error. 
Follow a TDD approach to solve for this as @task-execution.mdc 


# Continue until next task with expected output

Perfect, mark this task as completed and continue with the rest. 
Remember to mark the tasks as completed as you go along.
Ask me for validation when you finish a task with expected output
Do not ask for input unless there is an error you cannot solve


For reference check @small_comprehensive_documentation.md
Also, make sure you comply with @testing_best_practices.md 

# Start phase 

Start phase PHASE
Make sure to create a new branch following the branching model
